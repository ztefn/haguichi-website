In August 2007 development on Haguichi was started by <a href="https://www.stephenbrandt.com/" target="_blank">Stephen Brandt</a> in an effort to learn programming in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C#</a> and making use of the <a href="https://www.gtk.org" target="_blank">GTK</a> widget toolkit. Creating a <abbr title="Graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> for <a href="https://vpn.net" target="_blank">Hamachi</a> offered the opportunity to get acquainted with many different aspects like communicating with the command line, generating treeviews, storing application preferences and showing notifications. After some years of irregular but consistent development Haguichi was finally [released](/news/release090/) to the public on May 24, 2010.
