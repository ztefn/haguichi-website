Haguichi 1.0.3 has just set foot on soil bringing monochrome icons. Complete inventory:

  * Added theme specific panel icons for Humanity, Ambiance, Radiance, Elementary and Elementary Dark.
  * All pixmaps are now themable icons.
  * Removed gnome-sharp as dependency because the functionality used is also present in gtk-sharp.
  * Updated ownership detection for Hamachi 0.9.9.9-20 because the server response seems to have changed.
  * Removed maximum length from password entry in &#8220;Join Network&#8221;, &#8220;Create Network&#8221; and &#8220;Change Password&#8221; dialogs.
  * Spanish translation update.
