Haguichi 0.9.1 is out! Updates are:

  * Complete translations for three new languages: French, German and Spanish.
  * Haguichi is now able to automatically reconnect when the connection is lost.
  * Haguichi now waits for an established internet connection before trying to connect, if it&#8217;s configured to connect automatically at startup (fixes bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/588903" target="_blank">#588903</a>).
