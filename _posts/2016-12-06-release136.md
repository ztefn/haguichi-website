Haguichi 1.3.6 has been wrapped together with a nice bunch of updates:

  * Client side decorations are now used on Deepin and KDE desktops.
  * Added support for gvncviewer, vncviewer, xtightvncviewer, xvnc4viewer and rdesktop.
  * Added SSH to the default command set (as inactive).
  * Added [keyboard shortcuts](/tips-and-tricks/#keyboard-shortcuts) (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>9</kbd>) to execute available commands by corresponding order.
  * Added `%TUN` variable for use in [GSettings member templates](/tips-and-tricks/#customize-network-list) to display the tunnel in the network list.
  * Made the init system to control the hamachi daemon configurable in GSettings.
  * Network list updates are now skipped when `hamachi list` output is unchanged.
  * Retrieved long nicknames are now cached and saved using GSettings to improve performance.
  * Network ID&#8217;s are now properly escaped in tooltips and treeview.
  * Improved handling for invalid encoded nicknames.
  * Now falling back to xdg-open when Gtk.show_uri fails.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
