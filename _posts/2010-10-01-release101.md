Haguichi 1.0.1 is out! Changes are:

  * Added support for attaching the HamachiÂ² client to a LogMeIn account.
  * Improved out of the box support for different environments: 
      * The default commands are now using KDE applications when a KDE session is detected.
      * Automatic detection of the available graphical sudo command (currently checks for gksudo, gnomesu, kdesudo and kdesu).
      * Prevents GConf libraries from segfaulting when the configuration server isn&#8217;t running.
  * Added complete Japanese translations (thanks to Satoru Matsumoto).
  * Added command line options `--help`, `--version` and `--license`.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
