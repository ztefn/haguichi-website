Haguichi 1.0.18 has reached planet Earth, bringing along the following upgrades:

  * Implemented a workaround for <a href="http://community.logmein.com/t5/Hamachi/Hamachi-for-Linux-cuts-off-long-addresses-in-quot-hamachi-list/td-p/87658" target="_blank">addresses being cut off</a> in `hamachi list` command since LogMeIn <a title="Changes to Hamachi on November 19th" href="http://b.logme.in/2012/11/07/changes-to-hamachi-on-november-19th/" target="_blank">started using the 25/8 address space</a>. This workaround only works for online members.
  * The IPv6 address of a member is now ignored when an alias is set, because in that case the IPv6 address doesn&#8217;t work.
  * The network list now immediately reflects network ownership once determined.
  * Improved retrieval of long nicknames.
  * Now using a slightly faster method to check the internet connection.
  * French, Indonesian and Russian translations updated.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
