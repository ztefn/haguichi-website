Haguichi 1.0.5 has reached shore, bringing numerous refinements:

  * Nickname is now being remembered by Haguichi itself and is always set after each login, because HamachiÂ² seems to suffer from amnesia.
  * Now using regular expressions instead of splitting strings when parsing the network list (fixes bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/706567" target="_blank">#706567</a>).
  * Now using separate threads for the following actions: 
      * Change nickname
      * Join network
      * Create network
      * Change network password
      * Approve join request
      * Reject join request
      * Evict member
      * Leave network
      * Delete network
  * Added notification for when Hamachi loses connection.
  * Added option to manually update the network list.
  * Added check to prevent multiple parallel update cycles.
  * Added one seconds pause after login to receive a more updated network list from Hamachi.
  * Added function to determine the distro specific script directory to use (fixes bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/721314" target="_blank">#721314</a>).
  * Dialogs to change nick, join network and create network are now only created when called upon.
  * Attached all dialogs to the opening parent and made most of them modal.
  * Changed status icon behavior to take account for modal dialogs.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
