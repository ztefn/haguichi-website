In the world of Ubuntu and many of it&#8217;s derivatives, Haguichi has been providing an <a href="https://unity.ubuntu.com/projects/appindicators/" target="_blank">application indicator</a> ever since [version 1.0.7](/news/release107/). These type of indicators are unfortunately not supported in GNOME Shell (at least not without <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/" target="_blank">some help</a>). Therefore, I&#8217;m hereby introducing a dedicated <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1045/haguichi-indicator/" target="_blank">Haguichi Indicator</a> extension for GNOME Shell.

The extension is managed on <a href="https://github.com/ztefn/gse-haguichi-indicator" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. So get your ass over there if you want to report issues (bugs or feature requests) or even create your own fork!
