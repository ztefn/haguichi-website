Haguichi 1.0.25 has come around the corner to bring the following updates:

  * Improved shading of the hi-res application icon so that it looks better on dark backgrounds.
  * All automatically detectable terminal applications are now called using the `-e` option with (except for konsole) the argument enclosed in quotes.
  * Fixed crash that happened when disconnecting on quit.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
