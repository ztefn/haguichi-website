Haguichi 1.0.22 has left the building bearing these improvements:

  * Increased command throughput rate (fixes bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/1205527" target="_blank">#1205527</a>).
  * Refactored command execution code so that it can handle large output (fixes bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/1204250" target="_blank">#1204250</a>).
  * Now using ping to check the internet connection, which is more reliable and also faster in most cases.
  * Threads that could potentially be spawned many times are now added to the thread pool to enable queuing.
  * Added keyboard shortcuts to expand (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd>) and collapse (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd>) all networks.
  * Fixed crash that was triggered by changing the update interval.
  * Fixed regression that sometimes lead to wrong positioning of the main window.
  * Updated Italian, Kazakh and Russian translations.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
