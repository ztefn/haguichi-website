Haguichi 1.0.14 reached solid ground dragging along these updates:

  * Improved ownership detection for lists with multiple networks when using Hamachi 0.9.9.9-20.
  * Removed the checkbox &#8220;Go directly online in the network&#8221; which was shown in the &#8220;Join Network&#8221; and &#8220;Create Network&#8221; dialogs when using Hamachi 0.9.9.9-20.
  * From now on Haguichi will always trigger the Hamachi 0.9.9.9-20 client to go online in newly added networks to match the behavior of later clients.
  * Dutch and Polish translations updated.
