Haguichi 1.4.3 has emerged to deliver a compilation of little fixes and tweaks:

  * Fixed search entry leaving out the trigger character when activated by typing for the first time.
  * Added fallback method to detect if Hamachi configuration path exists when running inside a Flatpak sandbox while the path is not yet mounted.
  * Added symlinks to hicolor status icons in Yaru theme in order to prevent the indicator from falling back to the application icon.
  * Moved symbolic application icons for hicolor theme to a more specific folder to make sure they are rendered properly.
  * Symbolic icons are now used for the indicator on Cinnamon desktops.
  * Client side decorations are now used on MATE desktops.
  * Removed "Donate" menu item due to <a href="/donate/#donations">little use</a>.
  * Translator credits are now part of the translations themselves.
  * Added complete Portuguese translation (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rottenpants466" target="_blank">Andr√© Barata</a>).
  * Updated Dutch and Polish translations.
