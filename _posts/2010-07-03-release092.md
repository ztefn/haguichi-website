Haguichi 0.9.2 is now available. This release contains just a couple of small updates:

  * Complete translations for two new languages: Russian and Swedish.
  * Some other translation updates.
  * Fixed dialogs sometimes being visible shortly at startup.
  * Fixed unnecessary deployment of Main.cs file.

This will most likely be the last release in the 0.9 series as development focus will shift towards a new series adding support for HamachiÂ².
