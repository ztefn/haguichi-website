Haguichi 1.3.2 has arrived to squash a few bugs and to deliver some fresh translations:

  * Client side decorations are now used on latest Budgie desktop (fixes bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/1531266" target="_blank">#1531266</a>).
  * Fixed high CPU usage when using GTK+ 3.18 (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/1531587" target="_blank">#1531587</a>).
  * Fixed high CPU usage when dragging the window around.
  * Added 50 pixels to minimum window width when using GTK+ 3.18 to compensate for the headerbar title not requesting any width by itself.
  * Added complete Lithuanian translation (thanks to Moo).
  * Updated Indonesian translation.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
