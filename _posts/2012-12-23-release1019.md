Ho, ho, ho! Santa Claus has come to town and dropped some presents:

  * Applications to use as terminal, file manager and remote desktop viewer can now be automatically detected. Make sure your commands are respectively using the variables `%TERMINAL`, `%FILEMANAGER` or `%REMOTEDESKTOP`. 
      * Supported terminal emulators are (in order of priority) gnome-terminal, mate-terminal, pantheon-terminal, xfce4-terminal, konsole, and xterm.
      * Supported file managers are (in order of priority) nautilus, caja, nemo, pantheon-files, thunar and dolphin.
      * Supported remote desktop viewers are (in order of priority) vinagre and krdc.
  * Changed autostart .desktop file installation path from `/usr/etc/xdg/autostart` to `/usr/share/gnome/autostart` so that Haguichi will show up again in &#8220;Startup Applications&#8221;.
  * The workaround to retrieve complete addresses is not needed anymore for Hamachi 2.1.0.84 and newer, because the issue <a title="Hamachi Release Notes" href="http://help.logmein.com/SelfServiceReleaseNote?product=lmihamachi2" target="_blank">has been fixed</a> by LogMeIn.
  * When you run Haguichi for the very first time, from now on your username will be set as nickname.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
