Haguichi 1.3.5 has been dropped from the sky to supply the following changes:

  * Added line `OnlyShowIn=GNOME;MATE;Unity;X-Cinnamon;` to autostart .desktop file in order to prevent implicit automatic startup in other desktop environments.
  * Added line `X-GNOME-UsesNotifications=true` to application .desktop file in order to inform some desktop environments in advance that Haguichi may use notifications.
  * Made sure AppMenu will only ever be used on GNOME desktops (fixes bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/1531275" target="_blank">#1531275</a>).
  * Updated Russian translation.
  * Improved package dependency declarations for Debian based distro&#8217;s.
  * Other minor improvements and optimizations.
