Haguichi 1.0.7 has landed providing the option to replace the status icon with an appindicator. Full checklist:

  * Added support for communicating with <a href="https://launchpad.net/haguichi-indicator" target="_blank">Haguichi AppIndicator</a> over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus" target="_blank">D-Bus</a>.
  * Now showing the active session when a new session is started.
  * Added dependency on ndesk-dbus-glib.
  * Some layout changes to main menu and status icon menu.
  * Elementary and Elementary Dark panel icons are not included anymore because they are shipped upstream now.
  * Added complete Polish translations (thanks to Antoni Sperka).
