Haguichi 1.0.17 has beamed down to convey these updates:

  * Removed all support for Hamachi 0.9.9.9-20, because with that version it&#8217;s <a title="Upcoming Protocol Changes - LogMeIn Community" href="http://community.logmein.com/t5/Hamachi/Upcoming-Protocol-Changes/td-p/78963" target="_blank">not possible to login anymore</a>.
  * Added support for member error statuses introduced in Hamachi version 2.1.0.68.
  * Improved sorting by status.
  * Commands in the right click menu are now shown greyed out for members that are not online.
  * Now using alias as IPv4 address if set.
  * When using gksu or gksudo now showing the standard message again (but with descriptive name) to avoid confusion about what password to enter.
  * Network list updates can now be turned on or off separately from the update interval settings.
  * Added <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> accelerator for showing the preferences dialog.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
