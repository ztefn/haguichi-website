Haguichi 1.4.4 has undergone a small spring cleanup and is ready to face the world:

  * Added build support for <a href="https://github.com/AyatanaIndicators/libayatana-indicator" target="_blank">libayatana-indicator</a> as alternative to <a href="https://launchpad.net/libappindicator" target="_blank">libappindicator</a> (fixes issue <a href="https://github.com/ztefn/haguichi/issues/39" target="_blank">#39</a>).
  * Added invisible tooltips to action buttons in headerbar for screen readers and applications like <a href="https://github.com/p-e-w/plotinus" target="_blank">Plotinus</a>.
  * Tweaked action area margins for dialogs without headerbar.
  * Added <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> accelerator for opening the shortcuts window.
  * <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/wikis/App-Menu-Retirement" target="_blank">Retired application menu</a> and reorganized the primary menu to follow <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/primary-menus.html" target="_blank">GNOME HIG</a>.
  * Improved init system detection for systemctl by checking if the system has actually been booted with systemd (fixes issues <a href="https://github.com/ztefn/haguichi/issues/35" target="_blank">#35</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ztefn/haguichi/issues/36" target="_blank">#36</a>).
  * Dropped support for gksu(do), gnomesu and kdesu(do) to gain super user privileges.
  * Removed dconf migration for settings in old schema location.
  * Fixed build warnings about deprecated methods and error handling.
  * Updated Ukrainian translation.
