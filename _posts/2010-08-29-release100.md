As benevolent dictator of the Haguichi project I have the pleasant privilege to announce to you the immediate availability of Haguichi 1.0.0! And there&#8217;s a good reason for these round numbers, you know. Let me share them:

  * Elaborate support for the Hamachi² client, including: 
      * Managing access to your Hamachi² network (setting password, lock and approval method)
      * Sending join requests to when a network requires manual approval of your membership
      * Support for long nicknames (> 25 characters) of members in your list
  * Updating the network list and changing network status is now handled in the background (using threads) so the GUI stays responsive during these events.
  * Complete translations for one new language: Italian.
  * Added an interactive demo mode which acts as if there&#8217;s an Hamachi² client present, even when there&#8217;s not. Handy for taking screenshots or simply trying out Haguichi without having to install the Hamachi client. Start Haguichi from command line with option `--demo` to activate this mode.
  * New spiffy icons! Many thanks to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~calamandrei" target="_blank">Lapo Calamandrei</a> for creating the new sleeker base shape and giving me a live demo over IRC on how to draw highres icons.
