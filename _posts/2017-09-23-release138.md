  * Optimized network list parsing regular expressions for increased performance and speed.
  * Improved init system detection for systemctl by checking if the logmein-hamachi service unit is found or not.
  * Fixed crash that could occur when attaching the client to an account.
  * Ported the build system from CMake to Meson.
