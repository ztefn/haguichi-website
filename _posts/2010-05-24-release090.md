I am proud to announce the first public release of Haguichi. Haguichi provides a graphical frontend for Hamachi on Linux that integrates smoothly into your GNOME desktop.

This release contains all features required to control Hamachi plus much more. To discover all it&#8217;s features head over to the [download](/download/) section and give it a shot!

As this is the first public release you might stumble upon some bugs. If so, please report them <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi" target="_blank">here</a>. If you would like to help translating Haguichi into another language, you are welcome <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/haguichi" target="_blank">here</a>.

I hope you will enjoy using Haguichi!
