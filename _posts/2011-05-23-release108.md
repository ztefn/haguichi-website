Haguichi 1.0.8 has been set free. Most notably, this release offers unintrusive messages that replace annoying dialogs. For details, here&#8217;s the official record:

  * Replaced the following dialogs with messages in a message bar: 
      * Hamachi is not installed
      * Hamachi is not configured
      * Hamachi login failed
      * No internet connection
      * Connection refused
      * Send join request?
  * Added refresh button to &#8220;Hamachi is not installed&#8221; and &#8220;Hamachi is not configured&#8221; status messages.
  * Fixed status stuck at &#8220;Hamachi is not configured&#8221; after clicking &#8220;Configure&#8221; (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/751627" target="_blank">#751627</a>).
  * Removed &#8220;Configure&#8221; option from menubar and status icon menu.
  * Added right click menu to unused treeview space with options &#8220;Join Network&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Create Network&#8230;&#8221;.
  * Empty client nickname is now shown as &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; instead of &#8220;Unavailable&#8221;.
  * Status icon menu can now be triggered in modal state (with only the &#8220;Quit&#8221; option available).
  * Tweaked the connection restore handling.
  * Layout improvements for all dialogs.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
