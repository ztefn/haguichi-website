Haguichi 1.0.6 knocked on the door slightly earlier than expected:

  * Fixed mismatch between model and view when not showing offline members in the network list, which could result in crashes (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/723506" target="_blank">#723506</a>).
  * Now also collapsing or expanding networks after list updates.
  * Added support for using the variable `%ID` in commands, which prints the client&#8217;s ID.
