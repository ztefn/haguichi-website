Haguichi 1.0.26 introduces search in the network list to filter networks and clients. Just start typing to trigger this feature. If that&#8217;s a little too easy for your taste you can also navigate to Edit → Find in the menubar or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>. Complete list of changes:

  * Added a searchbar to filter networks and clients in the treeview.
  * Added accelerators for the actions Join Network (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>), Create Network (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>) and Show Offline Members (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>).
  * Activating the treeview row will not trigger the default command anymore if the selected member is not online.
  * Swapped out dependency on ndesk-dbus(-glib) for dbus-sharp(-glib).
  * Humanity panel icons are not included anymore because that theme has become outdated.
  * Added complete Slovak translation (thanks to Zdeněk Kopš).
  * Updated Czech, Kazakh and Turkish translations.
