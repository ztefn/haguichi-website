Haguichi 1.0.20 has arrived to provide these updates:

  * Added 48&#215;48 hicolor panel icons to accommodate Gnome Shell 3.6.
  * Swapped some icons in the icon chooser popup menu to improve cross icon theme compatibility.
  * Made some changes to basically support gateway networks (fixes bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/haguichi/+bug/1098755" target="_blank">#1098755</a>).
  * When (re)starting Hamachi, output from the init script is not being relied on anymore.
  * When Hamachi is busy, commands will now be run again a short moment later.
  * Join requests for networks that requires manual approval are now sent immediately without confirmation.
  * Improved many error and confirmation dialogs.
  * Other minor fixes, improvements and optimizations.
